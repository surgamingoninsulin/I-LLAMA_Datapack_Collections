## 🌟 About This Collection

Welcome to the `I-LLAMA Datapack Collections` repository! This repository serves as a centralized hub for a growing selection of high-quality Minecraft datapacks, meticulously crafted and curated to enhance your gameplay experience.

Our goal is to provide reliable, well-documented, and innovative datapacks that seamlessly integrate into your Minecraft worlds, offering new mechanics, optimizations, and fun features without the need for traditional mods.

**Key Features of This Collection:**

* **Diverse Functionality:** From quality-of-life improvements to new gameplay systems.
* **Easy to Install:** Simple drag-and-drop installation into your Minecraft world saves.
* **Regular Updates:** Datapacks are maintained and updated for compatibility with the latest Minecraft versions.
* **Open Source:** Transparent development and community-friendly where applicable.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Getting these datapacks into your Minecraft world is straightforward!

### Installation & Usage

1.  **Download the Datapack:**
    * Navigate to the [📦 Available Datapacks](#-available-datapacks) section below.
    * Find the datapack you wish to use.
    * Click on its name to find its `.zip` file, or navigate directly to the root of this repository.
    * Download the specific datapack `.zip` file you need (e.g., `I-LLAMA Datapack Collections - Woodwork.zip`). **Do NOT unzip it yet!**

2.  **Locate Your Minecraft Save Folder:**
    * **Windows:** Press `Win + R`, type `%appdata%\.minecraft\saves`, and press Enter.
    * **macOS:** Open Finder, press `Cmd + Shift + G`, type `~/Library/Application Support/minecraft/saves`, and press Enter.
    * **Linux:** Go to `~/.minecraft/saves`.

3.  **Find Your World Folder:** Inside the `saves` folder, navigate to the specific world where you want to install the datapack.

4.  **Open the `datapacks` Folder:** Inside your chosen world folder, you should see a folder named `datapacks`. If it doesn't exist, create it (make sure the name is exactly `datapacks` in lowercase).

5.  **Place the Datapack:** Drag and drop the downloaded `.zip` file (e.g., `I-LLAMA Datapack Collections - Woodwork.zip`) directly into the `datapacks` folder. Minecraft reads `.zip` files directly, so **do not unzip the datapack itself.**

6.  **Load/Reload in Minecraft:**
    * If your world is already open, run the command `/datapack enable "file/<datapack_name>"` (replace `<datapack_name>` with the name of the datapack, e.g., `woodwork`), or simply `/reload` (you need to be an operator to run these commands).
    * If you're starting the world, the datapack should be automatically recognized.
